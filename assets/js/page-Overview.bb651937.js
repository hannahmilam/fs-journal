I don't have that fear after this week. I love how this program is setup and that everyday you learn something new, and continue to build on those skills. Rather than learning something new and not using it for a while. I feel that it has helped me retain information and be able to grow my skills so much faster.\nI am still struggling with the @media rules, but after this challenge I feel a lot more confident about it.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=o.exports}}]);
