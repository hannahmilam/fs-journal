## Async & Await

## What is the purpose of Async/Await?
The purpose of Async and Await is to stop moving onto the next line in javascript until this action has been completed whether its a fail or its successful.

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
You have to first use async on the beginning of the function.

## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
Debugging is easier because the debugger would have normally stepped over asynchronous code, but it does not with async/await. It also is way more readable.  They make the code look synchronous, even though it isn't.
