# Capstones

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
In our project we are using javascript, bootstrap, css, html, vue, mongodb, and firebase in our capstone project. We are making an application for musicians to collaborate to make music together. We are having fun designing custom audio elements.

## What went well so far?
Our communication has been really awesome with the team I'm with. We all have been so great about helping out whenever somebody gets stuck and solving a problem as a team instead of just making that person who is assigned the task have to figure it out when they are stuck. We've also have just been having a lot of fun.

## What would you do differently? Why?
The biggest thing I would do differently is more planning in the beginning and spending more time with a detailed figma. We have had to stop several times during the process to re-eval what we wanted different pages or components to look like. It would have been a lot better had that all been decided in the beginning.
