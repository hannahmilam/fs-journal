# DataTypes
## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value type: Holds a data value within its own memory space.
Reference type: It stores the address where the value is being stored
Pointer type: You can convert between different pointer types and between pointer types and integral types.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
The value-type data types are: 
Bools, Bytes, Char, Decimal, Double, Enum, Float, Int, Long, Sbyte, Short, Struct, Uint, Ulong, Ushort. I noticed that javascript only uses floats, and does not use double or decimals.


## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Reference types hold the link and refer you to where the data is, similar to how during the capstone when we used firebase to hold the mp3 data and mongodb held the url to the firebase mp3. This varies from value types because a variable is assigned to hold that value.
