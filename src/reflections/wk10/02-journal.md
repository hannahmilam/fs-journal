# Lists

## What is a List in C#?
A list in C# is a generic type that can be a reference type or value type.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
The methods I would use most often would be Add, Remove, and Find. The reason these will be the most common is because you will always need to start with adding something to a list, getting them, and you will always need the ability to remove them. They are the most common because they are the most used.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
I would write a get function in order to access all information on the list, and in order to get a specific item on that list by accessing the index of that specific list item.
