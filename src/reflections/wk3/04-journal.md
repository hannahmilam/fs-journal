## The Observer Pattern

# What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
The observer pattern allows you to use reusable code, and "it enables one-to-many data binding between elements."

# What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
The three mechanisms of the observer patter are subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast.


# Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
In the ProxyState we assign the variable, and we access this variable using ProxyState in the controller and in the service files. The controller is where we draw items to the dom, and the service is where all of the business logic is.

(partnered with Jackson, after the afternoon challenge, I made some adjustments to the design under my own github.)
