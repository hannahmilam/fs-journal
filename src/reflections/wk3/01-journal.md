# What problem does using exports solve?
It makes it so you can access things that are in the different folders if needed, otherwise you would have no access to them and unable to put it on the page.

# How does export differ from export default?
export will export whatever you have specifically requested to export, but export default will only export the default classes, and not the additional ones that were created with different variations.

# What is a benefit of using the Module System?
The benefit is that it is way easier to locate stuff because they are in their own folders. You also can keep what needs to be private, private.
