## Encapsulation

# What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
The purpose of encapsulation is to keep your code secure. What this does is ensure that the public or regular user does not have access to the items that you do not want them to have access to.

# What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
A lot of developers and users are unaware of these methods and what they mean. So they use the properties anyway.


# How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
We create private variables with the 'let' and 'const' key words inside a function. They are block scoped so they can only be accessed inside that function. You would use this to help prevent people from depending on certain parts of your code.
