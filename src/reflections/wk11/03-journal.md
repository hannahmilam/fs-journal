# SQL
## What is SQL injection?
A SQL injection is when an attacker inserts arbitrary SQL into a web application query.

## What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?
Attackers can use cookies to insert SQL injection, HTTP headers can also be used as a SQL injection attack vector. Second-order SQL injection is another one, this one doesn't take affect right away, it actually takes affect later on.

## How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?
You can limit the amount of rows that are affected, check user input for invalid characters, unacceptable length, or any other abnormalities prior to processing or storing it on any production systems.
