# Routes

## What is a nested route?
Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other. 

## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
I might use a nested route if I wanted to go to a users/profile/posts. This would be a great way to use a nested route.

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
You can definitely pass parameters through nested routes. An example is when we used /:id parameter for accessing a specific users profile for this weeks checkpoint.
