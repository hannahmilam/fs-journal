## What is Component based architecture?
A component based architecture is where you have the design, logic, and helper methods all inside one level (a component).

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
It is so much easier to have your controller, view, and css tools inside one page. It makes naming css classes easier because you can scope it to that specific component. It makes functions so much smaller. There is no longer a need for listeners and draw functions. I could go on and on about the benefits.

## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
It can cause a lot of information inside one file.
