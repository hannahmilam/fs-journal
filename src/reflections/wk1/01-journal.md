# GIT: 3 reasons why

## Why do we use Git?
Git is a version control system, so we need to use it because most projects usually have more than on developer working together that may be using different versions of programs. Also, as stated in the article "The requirements in such projects change often." This version control system makes it so there isn't a coding conflict between developers, also the ability to use an older version of the code.


 ## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

 Having multiple branches is a huge benefit because if you have multiple parallels going on or are testing different code out you can have multiple branches going at once, while still having your master branch. This means that if you wanted to try something that you weren't sure if it was going to work without having to completely ruin your existing code you could have another branch that does just that while maintaining your master branch's integrity. Then once you have worked out what was needed, you then could merge your additional branch into your master.

 ## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

 The difference between Git and Github, is that Git is a version control system which is installed and maintained on your local system. GitHub is a cloud based hosting service which allows others to view your code and make edits.

## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
<ul><li>A pseudo-class is when you use a : after a selector.</li>
<li>Some common ones that were stated in the article are :after, :before, and :hover.</li></ul>

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
<ul><li>Specificity is a value that determines which CSS rule will be applied on an element when multiple conflicting rules may be placed on a single element.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I would use it in my benefit in a lot of ways but an example would be if I had created the rule that my body tag was a certain color and I needed a div tag that was inside my body tag to have a different color. I would assign a class to that div, and create a rule with that class which would raise the specificity and overrule the previous color.</li></ul>

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
<ul><li>The problems that I could run into would be if I was continually defaulting to !important versus using classes or ids to increase my specificity is that it's not something that can be overruled. </li>
<li>!Important can be bad because if you label something that high of a specificity and then decide to go in and make changes, they will not work because no matter how high the specificity is, where it says !important will always be what is printed on the screen.
</li></ul>
