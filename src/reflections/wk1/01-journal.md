# GIT: 3 reasons why

## Why do we use Git?
Git is a version control system, so we need to use it because most projects usually have more than on developer working together that may be using different versions of programs. Also, as stated in the article "The requirements in such projects change often." This version control system makes it so there isn't a coding conflict between developers, also the ability to use an older version of the code.


 ## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

 Having multiple branches is a huge benefit because if you have multiple parallels going on or are testing different code out you can have multiple branches going at once, while still having your master branch. This means that if you wanted to try something that you weren't sure if it was going to work without having to completely ruin your existing code you could have another branch that does just that while maintaining your master branch's integrity. Then once you have worked out what was needed, you then could merge your additional branch into your master.

 ## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

 The difference between Git and Github, is that Git is a version control system which is installed and maintained on your local system. GitHub is a cloud based hosting service which allows others to view your code and make edits.
