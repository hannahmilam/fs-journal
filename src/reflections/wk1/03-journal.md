# Cheating at Design

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
My favorite tip that I think will be most beneficial to improving my design is the text color versus text size. Looking at the difference at distinguishing between what is important or the title vs the paragraph looks so much better when you just change the color of the font.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
Figma, first and foremost, but also Adobe XD is an option as well. These will definitely help when trying to design a website before putting it into code.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
A good design is going to increase the value of the website, the company, and materials alone. When something is visually appealing people feel happier and want to spend their money on that product. If the website looks basic, and not very aesthetically pleasing they are going to associate that negative connotation with their product as well.
