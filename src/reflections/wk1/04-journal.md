# Wire-Framing

## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
The purpose of wire-framing is to figure out the basic design and format of the website and be able to tweak it in it's early stages.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
The three levels of wire-framing is low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. Each one is useful because low-fidelity helps gain an understanding of what you want the basic format to be and to be able to tweak it before more complex design pieces are added that are more difficult to change. 
The mid-fidelity is nice because you start to be able to see a little more detail and still without a lot of distraction. This is also where font size, weight, color and things like this will be able to be seen easier to tweak.
The high-fidelity is essentially what your website will look like with all of the colors and distractions. This is where you can really see what your website should look like in it's final stages and you can explore more of the interactive features.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Yes I absolutely do because getting your framework down before adding all of the colors and little details is so important. If you try to figure out your framework as you go you will spend so much more time de-bugging or trying to change what you already did because you decided you wanted the basic framework of the website to be changed.
