<li>What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?</li>
<ul><li>A pseudo-class is when you use a : after a selector.</li>
<li>Some common ones that were stated in the article are :after, :before, and :hover.</li></ul>

<li>What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?</li>
<ul><li>Specificity is a value that determines which CSS rule will be applied on an element when multiple conflicting rules may be placed on a single element.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I would use it in my benefit in a lot of ways but an example would be if I had created the rule that my body tag was a certain color and I needed a div tag that was inside my body tag to have a different color. I would assign a class to that div, and create a rule with that class which would raise the specificity and overrule the previous color.</li></ul>
<li>What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?</li>
<ul><li>The problems that I could run into would be if I was continually defaulting to !important versus using classes or ids to increase my specificity is that it's not something that can be overruled. </li>
<li>!Important can be bad because if you label something that high of a specificity and then decide to go in and make changes, they will not work because no matter how high the specificity is, where it says !important will always be what is printed on the screen.
