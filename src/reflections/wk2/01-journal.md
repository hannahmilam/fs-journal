## LET/CONST/VAR

# What is Scope?
Scope is where the variables are available for use. If you define a variable outside of a {} then it is a global scope. If you define a variable inside a {} it is a function scope.

# What is Hoisting?

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism. Variables can be used before they are declared and this is called hoisting. In JavaScript hoisting is the default behavior by moving all declarations to the top of the scope.

# In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

You would use var if you wanted to use it globally throughout the page, or a function. Let would be used in a block scope. Last but not least you would use const if you wanted your variable to not change.
