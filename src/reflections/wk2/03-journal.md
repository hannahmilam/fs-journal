## DEV TOOLS:

# What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
You can console.log after a function or you can go open up the dev tools, click on console, and type in the function name. I use this all of the time when I am testing new functions to see how they are working, if they are working, and when trying to debug something.


# Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML and CSS. This can be extremely useful because if you have something that is not in the right spot, or doing the wrong thing. You can click on the selector tool and then click on the element on the page and it will take you directly to all of the HTML and CSS tools for that item. Once you have done this, you can try out new css styles right there live without having to try it in your code, then save and refresh a ton of times.


# Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
Javascript debugging pane, or the "debugger". This is probably one of the best ways to debug your code because it takes it line by line as far as what your code is doing.
