## Functions

# What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
The three ways to syntactically write a function are; a Function Declaration, a Function Expressions, and an Arrow Function Expression.
Function expressions cannot be hoisted, so they cannot be used before they are defined, unlike a function declaration.

# What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

# What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
