# Partner checkpoint

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
I learned more of how to partner program, and what it means. What each person should be doing. I felt we worked really great as partners.

## What went well?
I think our communication for the most part went well, we agreed on what tasks we would each do and if we each got stuck on something we were there to help eachother. 

## What would you do differently?
I think next time I would spend a little more time in the planning phase as far as what we want the design to look like and how we want our project to go...Instead of just looking at the figma that was created for us.
