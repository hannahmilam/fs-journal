##  QUERY

# What is the purpose of a Query String?
The purpose of a Query String is to pass data. Once the data has been passed it can be stored in Node.

# What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
The parameter starts after the question mark. If you have multiple parameters then they are separated by an & symbol.

# When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
An example of how query parameters would be useful when writing servers is when you might have a lot of data being able to be accessed on a desktop, but on a mobile application you might not want pages of data. So you may have a query parameter to help limit what is on the screen.
