# Sub-Document

## In simple terms what is a sub-document?
A schema within a schema.

## When might you use a sub-document?
We used sub-documents on our hack-a-thon when we wanted to access post likes and comment likes on our server. We had likes inside both our post and comments schema.

## How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them?
To add to the collection of sub-documents you use the push method, and when you add an example of how to edit would be to use the findOneAndUpdate  method.
