# Vue Testing 

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit Testing, Component Testing, End-To-End (E2E) Testing are the three main types of testing. Unit testing tests small units of code. component testing will test an entire component, so bigger chunks of code. and end-to-end is the entire application.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think they are all useful in their own way. It depends on what stage you are in. They are all there for a reason. I think that end-to-end testing is the most useful beacuse you get the most information out of it.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
I think that component testing is the least useful, because you still get small amount of data. It doesn't seem to be as helpful as unit testing or end-to-end
