## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
Quality, speed, price. Well if you want quality work usually you cannot be speedy, quality takes time energy and effort. In addition to that if you are on a budget, then again time may not be able to have enough time to put in as much quality work as you would like. The trade off of speed and price are the same thing... When you try to speed things up or lower your budget again you will not have high quality work.
