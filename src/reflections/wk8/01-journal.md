# Portfolio

## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
A developer porfolio provides to the employer the skills the developer has. It showcases their applications they've worked hard on. It shows what languages this developer has due to what languages and frameworks the portfolio pieces are.

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
If the portfolio piece has clean code, lots of functionality, and is impressive then it will be effective in showcasing your skill to employers

## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I would like to have my capstone in my portfolio once it is finished because it will have been the biggest application we will have done to date. I also would like to put in buglog because it was our first full stack application that was made by me alone. I would like to fix up a few things first though.
